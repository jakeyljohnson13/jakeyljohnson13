## About me

My name is Jakeyl Johnson. I am an aspiring software developer currently enrolled in Year Up United. With a passion for technology, I aspire to master the tools necessary to impact the world in a way that makes life easier for all.

## I'm currently working on
As of now, I am in the learning and development phase of this program. Specifically, learning a myriad of coding concepts and techniques in Java through Intellij. Furthermore, the current topics include: polymorphism, abstraction, and inheritance. I am working on a project that utilizes these concepts in the form of a car dealership program.

## I'm looking to collaborate on
As a learner, I'm looking to work on anything I can get my hands on. I am especially open to working on projects that utilize techniques those willing to learn should know. If you are like me in that your starting your journey, or if you further wish to solidify your knowledge through basic techniques, let's collaborate!
